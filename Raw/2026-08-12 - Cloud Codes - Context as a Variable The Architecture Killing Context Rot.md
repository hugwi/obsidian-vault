# Context as a Variable: The Architecture Killing Context Rot

![Context as a Variable: The Architecture Killing Context Rot](https://www.youtube.com/embed/AvIujLlbmks)

## Description

Same model weights scored 30% on ARC-AGI 3, then 95% without retraining a single parameter. Here is how Recursive Language Models (RLMs) treat context as a Python variable to beat human expert baselines.


In this short, Cloud Codes breaks down the system design behind Alex Zhang's Recursive Language Models (RLMs) and Prime Intellect's Prime Agent framework. We examine how treating context as a live Python variable allows root models to spawn parallel child agents with clean, empty context windows—eliminating Context Rot and boosting ARC-AGI 3 scores from 30.2% to 95.5%.

## Transcript

The same model weights scored 30% on Arc AGI 3 and then 95. 12 days apart and nobody retrained anything. What changed was a loop around the model. Prime intellect dropped Opus 5 into a recursive harness and self-reported a run past a human expert baseline. That harness is built on recursive language models and they invert the whole setup. Your document stops entering the context window. It sits in a Python session as a variable and the model writes code to search it and call itself on the pieces. MIT measured it. On a 132,000 token benchmark, GPT-5 mini driving Python beat plain GPT-5 by 34 points while never reading the document itself at roughly the same cost per query. So recursion beats a bigger window and the harness is the product. Every leaderboard row you have read is a model plus a scaffold and only one of them gets a name. How much of the last 3 years was the wrapper?
