# Graphify + code-review-graph: Build a Self-Updating Knowledge Graph for Claude Code and other AI Coding Agent

- Full Title: Graphify + code-review-graph: Build a Self-Updating Knowledge Graph for Claude Code and other AI Coding Agent
- Category: #articles
- Summary: Graphify is best for exploring unknown code by showing connections, while CRG is better for precise symbol lookup. The system uses CRG first and falls back to Graphify only if needed to save resources. A special check prevents too many Graphify processes from running at once and overloading the computer.

## Full Document
>  Every developer working with LLMs on a large codebase eventually hits the same wall: context windows are finite, but codebases are not.
> 
>  

You start a new AI coding session, ask about the payment flow — and your agent starts re-reading dozens of files just to get oriented. Twenty thousand tokens evaporated before a single line of code is written. Multiply that by every session, every team member, every day.

Two open-source tools solve this in different but complementary ways:

* **Graphify** — converts your folder into a queryable knowledge graph with community detection, Obsidian-compatible reports, and cross-file traversal
* **code-review-graph (CRG)** — builds a SQLite-backed AST graph with blast-radius analysis, embedding-based semantic search, ~25 MCP tools (allow-listable to a working set of 8), and sub-second incremental updates

This guide walks through installing both tools, connecting them to any AI coding agent — Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, and more — wiring auto-updates for code edited by humans, git commits, or the agent itself, and pairing everything with an Obsidian vault as a persistent memory layer.

>  **Pick one, both, or none — every section degrades gracefully.** Each tool works standalone; the smart-grep-hook, session-start cheatsheet, and CLAUDE.md routing rules all detect what is present and adapt. Use just graphify if you want a pure CLI / zero-MCP setup. Use just CRG if you want embedding-aware semantic search and PR-grade impact tools. Use both for the full stack (CRG primary, graphify on miss). If neither is installed, the agent silently falls back to grep — no broken hooks, no errors.

All commands in this guide were tested on Ubuntu and macOS across multiple real pnpm monorepos of varying sizes.

####  Real Numbers from Two Test Projects

Before diving in, here's what both tools produced across two real codebases — one a full-stack TypeScript monorepo with 5 packages, the other a lighter frontend-only repo:

| Metric | Graphify (AST-only) | code-review-graph |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Files indexed (large) | 1,020 | 1,052 |
| Nodes (large) | 3,815 | 5,780 |
| Edges (large) | 4,830 | 30,611 |
| Files indexed (small) | 702 | 711 |
| Nodes (small) | 2,035 | 2,773 |
| Edges (small) | 2,357 | 15,037 |
| Communities | 750 / 499 | 28 wiki pages each |
| Incremental update | ~10s (8 workers) | **0.425s** |
| LLM tokens used | 0 | 0 |
| Storage | `graphify-out/` (JSON) | `.code-review-graph/` (SQLite) |

####  How Each Tool Works

####  Installation

Install one or both — the rest of the guide shows where each section applies.

#####  Ubuntu

```
# Pick what you need:
pip install graphifyy         # graphify CLI (note: two y's on PyPI)
pip install code-review-graph # CRG (CLI + MCP server, includes embeddings extra)

# Verify (only the lines for installed tools):
graphify --help | head -5
code-review-graph --version

```

#####  macOS

```
# Via uv (fastest):
uv tool install graphifyy           # graphify only
uv tool install code-review-graph   # CRG only — or run both lines for both

# Or via pipx:
brew install pipx
pipx install graphifyy
pipx install code-review-graph

```

>  **PyPI quirk**: The package is `graphifyy` (two y's). The CLI command after install is `graphify` (one y).
> 
>  

####  Step 1: Create Ignore Files

Before building any graph, exclude noise from indexing. Place these at your project root.

**`.graphifyignore`**

```
node_modules/
dist/
build/
.pnpm-store/
coverage/
*.min.js
*.min.css
*.map
pnpm-lock.yaml
yarn.lock
*.lock
*.log
.env*
graphify-out/
.code-review-graph/
*.example.*

```

**`.code-review-graphignore`** (same content)

```
node_modules/
dist/
build/
.pnpm-store/
coverage/
*.min.js
*.min.css
*.map
pnpm-lock.yaml
yarn.lock
*.lock
*.log
.env*
graphify-out/
.code-review-graph/
*.example.*

```

####  Step 2: Build the Graphs Manually

#####  code-review-graph

```
cd /path/to/your-project

# Full build (first time) — parses all files
code-review-graph build

# Output (large monorepo):
# Full build: 1052 files, 5780 nodes, 30611 edges (postprocess=full)

# Output (smaller frontend repo):
# Full build: 711 files, 2773 nodes, 15037 edges (postprocess=full)

```

#####  Graphify (AST-only, no LLM cost)

```
cd /path/to/your-project

# AST-only update (no API key required)
graphify update .

# Output (large monorepo):
# Rebuilt: 3815 nodes, 4830 edges, 750 communities
# graph.json, graph.html and GRAPH_REPORT.md updated in graphify-out

# Output (smaller repo):
# Rebuilt: 2035 nodes, 2357 edges, 499 communities

```

For the richer semantic graph (PDFs, images, markdown — uses LLM):

```
# Full extraction with Claude subagents (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
graphify extract .

```

####  Step 3: Register with Your AI Agent

#####  code-review-graph (auto-configures 5 platforms)

```
code-review-graph install

```

This single command:

* Writes `.mcp.json` (Claude Code MCP server config)
* Writes `.cursor/mcp.json`, `.opencode.json`, Zed settings, `.cursorrules`, `GEMINI.md`, `AGENTS.md`
* Creates `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code tool integration
* Installs hooks in `.claude/settings.json` (move these out — see below)
* Installs a **git pre-commit hook**
* Updates `.gitignore` to exclude `.code-review-graph/`

**Post-install housekeeping:** `code-review-graph install` is aggressive — it writes configs for every AI IDE it knows about. Most teams only use one. Add the noise to `.gitignore`:

```
# .gitignore additions
AGENTS.md
GEMINI.md
.mcp.json          # keep only .mcp.example.json
.cursorrules
.windsurfrules
.opencode.json
.kiro/

```

**Three-file hook pattern:** `settings.json` stays clean — permissions only, no hooks. Hooks go into example/local:

* **`.claude/settings.example.json`** (committed) — documents the full hook structure for teammates. Contains all graph hooks (Stop, SessionStart, PreToolUse). Copy from here to activate.
* **`.claude/settings.local.json`** (gitignored) — your actual personal hooks that fire at runtime. Copy from `settings.example.json` on first setup, then customize with env vars or secrets. You can also copy individual hooks into your **global `~/.claude/settings.json`** if you want them active across all projects.

```

// Copy this file to .claude/settings.local.json and customize

```

>  **Why Stop, not PostToolUse?** `PostToolUse` fires after *every* individual file edit — if Claude makes 10 edits in one response, it fires 10 times. The `pgrep` guard that prevents double-spawning has a race window of a few milliseconds, which is not enough to block concurrent spawns reliably. The result: multiple CRG Python processes pile up, load average hits 12+, RAM saturates, and the machine slows to a crawl. `Stop` fires **once** when the AI finishes its entire turn — all edits batched, single update triggered. The PID-file guard then prevents overlap *across* turns (skip if the previous turn's update is still running). Zero pile-up by design.
> 
>  **Why graphify update is NOT in any Claude hook:** `graphify update` takes ~10s+ on a real monorepo (even with SHA256 caching). Running it in `Stop` or `PostToolUse` would block the session or cause the process to hang in the background, accumulating across turns. It belongs only in git hooks (`post-commit`, `post-checkout`) where it runs as a fully detached `nohup` process after the commit returns — the developer has already moved on, so the latency is invisible.

```
# .claude/settings.local.json — gitignored, actual runtime hooks (copy from example)

```

The `.mcp.json` it creates (keep as `.mcp.example.json` only):

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "code-review-graph": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["code-review-graph", "serve"],
      "type": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

#####  Graphify (AI Agent Integration)

```
# Adds graphify section to CLAUDE.md + PreToolUse hook (Claude Code)
graphify claude install

```

Graphify's `claude install` adds a `PreToolUse` hook that intercepts `grep`, `rg`, `find` commands and redirects the agent to `graphify query` instead — turning search interception into graph navigation. For other agents: `code-review-graph install` already writes equivalent config to `GEMINI.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, and Zed settings.

>  **Note:** `graphify claude install` writes the `PreToolUse` hook into `.claude/settings.json`. Move it to `.claude/settings.example.json` (committed as a reference) and copy to `.claude/settings.local.json` to activate it locally — not every teammate will have graphify installed, so it shouldn't fire automatically for everyone.

#####  Auto-Update on Commit (the full picture)

[![Auto-Update Triggers: PostToolUse, git commit, branch switch](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fjwt5sqmh30h4mejuc8fz.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fjwt5sqmh30h4mejuc8fz.png)
Three independent triggers keep the graph fresh — install all of them so no edit path leaves it stale:

| Trigger | Hook location | Tool | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Claude finishes a turn** | `settings.example.json` → `settings.local.json` Stop hook | **CRG only** | ~0.425s — fast enough to run after every AI turn; PID-guarded |
| **Any commit** | `.git/hooks/post-commit` (or `.husky/post-commit`) | **graphify + CRG** | terminal commits, IDE commits, other AI tools; graphify runs as background `nohup` |
| **Branch switch** | `.git/hooks/post-checkout` (or `.husky/post-checkout`) | **graphify + CRG** | smart: ≤5 files diff → incremental update; >5 files or new branch → full rebuild; background `nohup` |

>  **graphify is NOT in the Claude Stop hook.** `graphify update` takes ~10s+ on large monorepos — too slow for an AI turn hook. It would pile up, hang in the background, and saturate CPU/RAM (observed: 3 stuck processes at 65–73% CPU each). Use git hooks instead — the developer has already moved on by the time graphify finishes.
> 
>  

Graphify ships its own installer for the git side:

```
graphify hook install   # writes post-commit + post-checkout

```

**Code-review-graph does not.** Its `install` command writes a `pre-commit` hook that runs `detect-changes --brief` (a status warning before the commit lands) but no `post-commit` hook to update the SQLite graph after. Without one, `.code-review-graph/graph.db` only refreshes when Claude touches a file — every terminal/IDE/other-tool commit drifts.

Add the post-commit update yourself. Both forms are detached so `git commit` returns immediately.

>  **Resource guard required.** Graph rebuilds are CPU-intensive. Without guards, multiple rebuilds can pile up (observed: 3 concurrent graphify processes at 65–73% CPU each, load average 12+, RAM saturated). Every hook below includes a `_resources_ok` check (CPU ≤ 50% of cores, memory ≥ 2 GB free) and a `pgrep` process deduplication guard. If either check fails, the rebuild silently skips — the next commit retriggers a fresh attempt.
> 
>  

**Plain git project — append to `.git/hooks/post-commit`:**

```
#!/bin/sh
# Knowledge graph tools are optional — each section silently skips if tools are absent.

# Returns 0 (ok) when CPU load and free memory are within acceptable limits.
# CPU: 1-min load average must be <= 50% of logical core count (Linux/macOS)

**Husky project — create `.husky/post-commit`** (Husky v9+ runs `.husky/<hookname>` directly; no `.husky/_/` shim editing needed). The content is identical to the plain git version above — copy the entire script. Always prefer `update --skip-flows` (incremental, sub-second) over `build` (full rebuild — minutes on large repos):

```
# .husky/post-commit — same content as .git/hooks/post-commit above
# (copy the full script from the plain git example)

```

Verify both graphs caught up to the latest commit:

```
git log -1 --format=%ci                          # last commit timestamp
stat -f %Sm graphify-out/graph.json              # macOS
stat -f %Sm .code-review-graph/graph.db          # macOS
# stat -c %y graphify-out/graph.json             # Linux equivalent

```

Both file mtimes should be at or after the commit timestamp. If `graph.db` lags, the post-commit hook isn't firing — check `chmod +x` on the hook file and that `pnpm install` ran (so Husky's `prepare` script wired up `.husky/`).

#####  Agent Config: trigger-list pattern (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `GEMINI.md`)

Rather than pasting the full tool docs into your agent config file (which bloats every session's context), create a dedicated `docs/agent/knowledge-graph.md` and add a trigger-list pointer. This works the same way across agents — Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`, Gemini CLI reads `GEMINI.md`, Codex and OpenAI agents read `AGENTS.md`:

```
## Knowledge Graph

**Read `docs/agent/knowledge-graph.md` whenever you:**
- Answer any architecture, cross-module, or "how does X work" question
- Plan to grep, find, or glob through the codebase
- Need to understand an unfamiliar module or trace a call chain
- Are about to refactor or change something with unclear blast radius

The doc covers graphify (community detection, path tracing, GRAPH_REPORT.md), code-review-graph (MCP tools, impact analysis), when to use each, and the full auto-update pipeline.

```

Place this block in `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, or `AGENTS.md` for Codex/OpenAI-compatible agents — the trigger-list pattern works the same across all of them. A vague "read before exploring unfamiliar code" pointer is easy for any agent to skip. Explicit trigger conditions — especially "plan to grep" — activate the graph habit reliably. The full reference lives in `docs/agent/knowledge-graph.md` and is only loaded when actually needed.

#####  Enforcing Graph-First: The Smart Grep Hook

The trigger-list in `CLAUDE.md` is a soft nudge — in practice, agents still reach for grep by default even with both knowledge graphs initialized and the pointer in place. Soft warnings alone do not reliably change behaviour.

The fix is a smarter `PreToolUse` hook that doesn't just warn — it **answers the question inside the rejection**, and handles every scenario gracefully: no graph, cross-repo grep, multi-repo registries.

**Decision ladder (first match wins, zero false positives):**

| Situation | Hook behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| No graph in this repo, no registered siblings | Silent pass — zero noise |
| Non-code target (`.md`, `.json`, `.log`, `.jsonl`) | Silent pass |
| `--graph-tried` flag in command | Silent pass — explicit override |
| Grep targets abs path outside CWD + that dir has graph | Query that graph, show result as context, allow grep |
| Grep targets abs path outside CWD + no graph found | Silent pass — grep is the right tool here |
| No local graph + registered sibling repo matches pattern | Show sibling result as context, allow grep |
| First grep this session + local graph hit | Show answer **and** allow grep (one-shot lesson) |
| First grep this session + no graph hit | Allow grep, suggest MCP tool for next time |
| Subsequent grep + local graph hit | **Deny with answer inline** — zero retry loop |
| Subsequent grep + no graph hit | Silent pass |

The key insight: **the deny message IS the answer**. The costly retry loop (deny → model reads error → model tries graph → gets answer = 2 API calls) collapses to 1.

Three graph sources, consulted in priority order:

1. **Local graph** — `.code-review-graph/graph.db` in current working directory
2. **Cross-repo graph** — walk up from any absolute path in the command to find the nearest `.code-review-graph/` directory
3. **Multi-repo registry** — `code-review-graph repos` for globally registered repos

All lookups use the `nodes_fts` FTS5 full-text index — sub-millisecond, no external process, no network. Falls back to a `LIKE` scan if FTS returns empty.

#      b. No graph in target             → pass silently
#   5. No local graph of either type:
#      a. CRG registered repo match     → show context, allow grep
#      b. Global merged graphify match  → show context, allow grep
#      c. No match                      → pass silently
#   6. Local graph(s) present — session-aware gating:

#      b. First grep + miss             → allow, suggest tool for next time
#      c. Subsequent + hit              → answering deny (result inline, no retry)
#      d. Subsequent + miss             → pass silently

**Why `--graph-tried` beats a hard block:**

13 characters. The agent adds it when it has already consulted the graph or when the query targets content the AST graph cannot index (string literals, config values, log text, content in another language not indexed). The hook detects the flag and passes silently — legitimate grep is never more than one retry away.

**Cross-repo and no-graph: always allow, never penalise:**

The hook is non-blocking in every case where the graph can't definitively help. Cross-repo greps get graph context shown as additional info, not a gate. Repos without any graph see zero hook overhead. The only hard deny is when the local graph has the exact answer — and even then, `--graph-tried` is the immediate escape.

**Session state (hourly bucket per repo):**

```
~/.cache/claude-graph-hook/
├── first-grep-<repo-hash>-<YYYYMMDDHH>   ← one-shot allowance marker
└── bypass.log                             ← audit: greps that passed with no graph answer

```

The allowance resets hourly. The `bypass.log` is an audit trail — recurring patterns signal queries worth adding to a custom graph index or documentation.

######  Symbol and concept lookups

| Query | grep | graphify query | CRG keyword | CRG semantic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "Where is `createThread`?" | **594 tokens** (2374 chars, 24 lines) | **1532 tokens** (165 nodes, BFS depth=2) | 115 tokens | **115 tokens** |
| "uiState persistence layer" | **1069 tokens** (4274 chars, 43 lines) | **1552 tokens** (87 nodes) | miss | **100 tokens** |
| "comment submit handler" | 114 tokens (narrow query) | **1538 tokens** | miss | **100 tokens** |
| "what imports api.ts?" | 437 tokens (filenames only) | **1563 tokens** (378 nodes) | 125 tokens (41 results) | **125 tokens** |
| "who calls `createThread`?" | ~1109 tokens + manual filter | **1532 tokens** | 80 tokens | **80 tokens** |
| "error handling in server" | **2220 chars** (noise: auto-generated .react-router types) | **1538 tokens** | 477 chars (source only) | **477 chars** |

**Hidden grep cost:** after a grep hit the model usually reads the matched file. `comment-form.tsx` = 909 tokens. `comment-thread.tsx` = 1397 tokens. A typical grep + follow-up read costs **1300–2500 tokens per question**. CRG returns `file:line` — no follow-up read needed.

**Signal quality gap:** grep returns every file containing the pattern — including `dist/`, generated `.react-router/types/`, auto-compiled `.d.ts`, and `node_modules` leakage. CRG indexes only what Tree-sitter parses as source. For the "error handling" query: grep returned 20 lines from auto-generated type files before any real source. CRG returned 5 precise hits: `sendError` and `withJsonBody` in `http-utils.ts`, `ErrorBoundary` in `root.tsx` and `diff.tsx`. Zero noise.

**graphify query — right tool, wrong use case:** BFS depth=2 returns 87–378 nodes (~1500 tokens) regardless of query specificity. For *symbol lookup* ("where is createThread?"), this is 15× more expensive than CRG semantic. For *neighborhood exploration* ("what connects to this module when I don't know the codebase?"), the BFS output is exactly what you want — a visual map of relationships. The smart-grep hook intercepts it for symbol queries and routes through CRG; if CRG misses, graphify query proceeds. Use `graphify query` deliberately for exploration, not as a default lookup tool.

**Why graphify appears less in session logs than you'd expect:** In a measured multi-hour session on a 1336-node monorepo, graphify had 2 actual code lookups vs CRG's 36 graph tool calls. This is correct behaviour, not underuse. CRG with embeddings covers 90%+ of targeted symbol and concept queries at 100–350 tokens — graphify BFS for the same query returns 1,500 tokens. The session was targeted feature work on a *known* codebase; both tools appropriately routed to CRG. Graphify's value surface is: unfamiliar codebase onboarding, cross-community architecture tracing, and path exploration between distant modules — none of which were needed. If the session had started with "I've never seen this codebase, orient me", graphify would have dominated.

**The CRG-miss → grep fallback gap:** When `semantic_search_nodes_tool` returns 0 results (happened 3× for exact symbol names like `validateRef`, `parseUnifiedDiff`), the current cheatsheet doesn't tell the agent to try `graphify query` next. The agent falls back to grep, which returned 6–29 chars of near-nothing. The correct fallback chain is: `CRG semantic (miss) → graphify query '<term>' → grep`. Add this line to your CLAUDE.md trigger list or SessionStart cheatsheet to close the gap:

```
CRG 0 results → graphify query '<term>' --graph graphify-out/graph.json

```

######  What grep cannot do at all

Some questions require multi-hop graph traversal. Grep answers the *text search* question; it cannot answer the *dependency* question.

**Scenario: "What breaks if I change `server.ts`?"**

With grep you would need to:

1. Read `server.ts` header to find what it exports (~828 chars)
2. `grep -rn "startServer" packages/` to find 1-hop callers (~715 chars)
3. For each caller found, grep again for their importers (~309+ chars)
4. Aggregate manually — still missing transitive re-exports and inferred dependencies

Total: **3 separate operations, 1852+ chars, still incomplete.**

With `get_impact_radius_tool`:

```
{"summary": "Blast radius for server.ts:
  - 21 nodes directly changed
  - 500 nodes impacted (within 2 hops)
  - 135 additional files affected",
 "risk": "high",
 "key_entities": ["completer","promptBranch","fetchDefaultReviewers"]}

```

**1 call, 274 chars, complete 2-hop picture, risk rating included.**

Grep reaches one level of importers in one pass. To get two levels, you need to loop. To get re-exports of re-exports, you need to understand the module graph. `get_impact_radius_tool` does all of this from the pre-built AST graph — sub-second.

This matters most before refactoring: touching a widely-imported file without an impact check risks breaking 135 files silently.

######  `get_review_context_tool` — best single call for code review

Before any code review, this one call returns: risk level, impacted node count, impacted file count, and test gaps — all in ~111 tokens (session-measured average; range 80–270 depending on depth). No follow-up reads needed.

```
get_review_context_tool(changed_files=["packages/git/src/threads.ts"], depth="minimal", include_source=false)

→ Risk: high
→ 359 impacted nodes in 126 files
→ test_gaps: 15

```

Compare with manually: read file (828 tokens) + grep importers (715 tokens) + read callers to assess risk (1400+ tokens) = **2943 tokens, incomplete**.

Add it to your review workflow via the SessionStart cheatsheet — it fires once per session at ~150 tokens total, pointing the agent at this tool first for any PR or diff review.

######  Real session measurement: complete token accounting

The per-query numbers above cover tool result sizes. A complete picture must also include the hidden context costs each approach carries: MCP schema overhead, required setup reads, and cache dynamics. These numbers were measured from a live multi-hour coding session on the same 1336-node monorepo (578 total API calls).

**Hidden context overhead per approach:**

| Approach | Schema/setup overhead | Per-call result | How it's paid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| grep | **0 tokens** (none) | ~550 tok/call | per call, direct |
| graphify CLI | **0 tokens** (it's a Bash call) | ~292 tok/call | per call, direct |
| + GRAPH\_REPORT.md | +458 tok (partial read, measured) | one-time | Read into context once |
| CRG MCP tools | **~6,000 tok always** (~25 tool schemas, default) — drops to ~1,800 tok with `CRG_TOOLS` allow-list (8 tools) | ~69–1,359/call | written to cache on cold start, then served from cache at 10× lower cost |

**Honest full-session accounting (37 graph tool calls):**

| What | With CRG | With grep+Read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Schema/setup overhead | ~6,000 tok (cached) | 0 |
| Tool result tokens | 14,167 tok (measured) | 110,335 tok (estimated) |
| **Total** | **~20,167 tok** | **~110,335 tok** |
| **Net saving** | **~90,168 tokens — 5.5× cheaper after schema overhead** | — |

CRG schema tokens are written to the prompt cache on the first API call of a session (cold start: 59,310 tokens including system prompt + all tool schemas). After that they're served from `cache_read` at $0.30/MTok — one-tenth the cost of new input ($3.00/MTok). The `get_architecture_overview_tool` block saved 33,000 tokens from a single denied call; that alone exceeds the CRG schema overhead.

**Cache economics for the full session:**

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Cold-start cache\_write (call 1) | 59,310 tokens — full context incl. all schemas |
| Total cache\_write across session | 3,056,502 tokens |
| Cold-start share of writes | 1.9% |
| Total cache\_read | 50,942,267 tokens |
| New input tokens | 7,694 tokens |
| Est. session cost (Sonnet 4.x) | ~$36 (cache\_write $11.46 + cache\_read $15.28 + output $9.49) |

Estimated cost without CRG (same session, grep+Read instead): the additional 90K tool result tokens would each need to be cache-written then read — adding roughly $0.34 in cache\_write + $2.70 in cache\_read per 100K tokens. More importantly, a larger context window means cache blocks expire and must be re-created more often, compounding costs across 578 calls.

**Three-way comparison including all hidden costs (37 lookup calls, measured session):**

```

Follow-up Read?       +~1,842 tok   not needed        not needed

  + overhead          0             +458 tok          +6,000 tok
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  TOTAL               ~20,350 tok   ~11,262 tok       ~20,167 tok

Net saving            ~5.4×         ~9.8×             ~5.5×

```

**graphify CLI is the most token-efficient per lookup** when full overhead is counted — zero MCP schema tax, no follow-up Read needed, compact output. Its limitation is output size at BFS scale (87–378 nodes, ~1,500 tokens) and needing GRAPH\_REPORT.md for orientation. For targeted symbol lookup CRG wins; for schema-free cost-conscious exploration graphify wins.

**CRG's 6K schema overhead pays back fast**: the blocked `get_architecture_overview_tool` call alone saved 33,000 tokens — 5× the entire schema overhead — from a single hook denial in this session. After cold-start, schemas cost $0.30/MTok (cache\_read) not $3.00/MTok (new input).

**Graphify vs CRG split:** graphify had 2 actual code lookups; CRG had 36 tool calls. This is the right ratio for targeted feature work on a known codebase — CRG semantic search (100–350 tok) dominated because the work was precise. Graphify BFS (~1,500 tok) is for orientation on unfamiliar ground. Same session on an unknown codebase would flip the ratio.

#####  Strip Unused CRG Tools (Cuts Schema Overhead 70%)

CRG registers **25 MCP tools by default** but a typical session uses ~8. Every unused tool still costs always-loaded schema tokens. CRG ships with a built-in allow-list filter — `_apply_tool_filter` removes tools at server boot via `mcp.local_provider.remove_tool(name)`. Filtered tools cannot be invoked at all, so the explicit PreToolUse block on `get_architecture_overview_tool` becomes redundant.

**Set `CRG_TOOLS` in `~/.claude.json` mcpServers env (or pass `serve --tools ...`):**

```
"mcpServers": {
  "code-review-graph": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": ["--with", "code-review-graph[embeddings]", "code-review-graph", "serve"],
    "env": {
      "CRG_TOOLS": "semantic_search_nodes_tool,query_graph_tool,get_impact_radius_tool,traverse_graph_tool,list_communities_tool,get_community_tool,get_review_context_tool,list_graph_stats_tool"
    }
  }
}
```

**The 8-tool working set covers 95% of session usage:**

| Tool | When |
| --- | --- |
| `semantic_search_nodes_tool` | "where is X defined" — embedding match, ~100–350 tok |
| `query_graph_tool` | callers/callees/relations — `pattern=callers_of`, ~80 tok |
| `get_impact_radius_tool` | pre-refactor blast radius |
| `traverse_graph_tool` | dependency walk (keep depth ≤ 3) |
| `list_communities_tool` | architecture overview, ~170 tok for 12 clusters |
| `get_community_tool` | cluster drill-down |
| `get_review_context_tool` | code review with risk + test gaps, ~111 tok avg |
| `list_graph_stats_tool` | sanity check / status |

**Dropped (17 tools):** `get_architecture_overview_tool` (33k tok output — never useful), `refactor_tool` / `apply_refactor_tool` (use git), `get_minimal_context_tool`, `get_docs_section_tool`, `get_wiki_page_tool`, `find_large_functions_tool`, `list_flows_tool` / `get_flow_tool` / `get_affected_flows_tool` (flow analysis is rare), `get_hub_nodes_tool` / `get_bridge_nodes_tool` (covered by communities), `get_knowledge_gaps_tool`, `get_surprising_connections_tool`, `get_suggested_questions_tool`, `list_repos_tool` / `cross_repo_search_tool` (single-repo work).

**Token math:**

* Before: ~6,000 tok schema overhead (25 tools, full descriptions + params, always loaded after cold-start)
* After: ~1,800 tok (8 tools)
* Savings: **~4,200 tok per session, ~70% schema reduction**
* Bonus: Claude Code's deferred-tool layer further lazy-loads param schemas via `ToolSearch` — only the description metadata stays always-loaded, so real overhead is even lower

**Lazy loading reality check:** MCP protocol itself does not support lazy-loading tool schemas — all are listed at startup. Claude Code adds a deferred-tool layer on top: tool *descriptions* are exposed for matching, but full param schemas only load when `ToolSearch` resolves a tool by name. So stripping at the CRG layer cuts the always-loaded description set; the Claude Code layer cuts the params. They compound.

**By case:**

| Workflow | Strategy |
| --- | --- |
| Targeted symbol lookup on known codebase | `semantic_search_nodes_tool` → fallback to `query_graph_tool` → fallback to `graphify query` → grep |
| Pre-refactor blast | `get_impact_radius_tool` + `traverse_graph_tool(depth=2)` |
| Architecture orientation | `list_communities_tool` → `get_community_tool` (NEVER `get_architecture_overview_tool`) |
| Code review on a PR | `get_review_context_tool(changed_files=[...])` only |
| Cross-repo work | re-add `cross_repo_search_tool`, `list_repos_tool` to allow-list |
| Flow / DAG analysis | re-add `list_flows_tool`, `get_flow_tool`, `get_affected_flows_tool` |

**The concurrent session had zero graph tools:** a parallel session on the same codebase used only grep+Read (15 grep calls, 22 reads). Cold start: 60,610 tokens (same MCP schemas loaded — schemas are always present regardless of whether graph tools are used). Tool result tokens were proportionally higher per lookup, with no structured relationship data returned.

>  **Bypassing the smart-grep hook:** append `# --graph-tried` as a shell *comment* (not a flag) to pass silently: `grep -rn "TODO" src/ # --graph-tried`. On macOS, ugrep rejects `--graph-tried` as an unknown flag — always use it as a comment.
>

#####  Expensive Calls to Avoid

Some graph tool calls look useful but are token-budget traps.

**`get_architecture_overview_tool`** — returns 131,000 chars (~33,000 tokens), exceeds any usable context budget. **Best fix: strip it via `CRG_TOOLS` allow-list** (see "Strip Unused CRG Tools" above) so it cannot be called at all. If you can't strip it, block via PreToolUse hook. Alternative: `list_communities_tool` first (~170 tokens for 12 clusters), then `get_community_tool` for any cluster you want to drill into.

**`graphify query '<term>'`** — BFS depth=2 returns 87–378 nodes (~1500 tokens) regardless of specificity. The smart-grep hook intercepts it: if CRG has a matching symbol it blocks with the CRG result inline (~100 tokens); if CRG misses it allows graphify to proceed but warns about cost. This is the right split — CRG for symbol lookup, graphify for neighborhood exploration when you genuinely want to see what's connected.

**`traverse_graph_tool` on hub nodes without budget** — takes a `query` string (not source/target nodes), does concept-based traversal, and at depth=5+ on hub nodes (`server.ts`, `api.ts`) returns thousands of nodes. Keep `depth ≤ 3` and `token_budget ≤ 1500`. For a specific A→B path, use `graphify path '<A>' '<B>'` instead — it returns the shortest hop chain in ~200 tokens. For "who calls X", use `query_graph_tool(pattern=callers_of, target=X)` (~80 tokens).

**Tool stripping > hook blocking.** The cleanest enforcement is the `CRG_TOOLS` allow-list shown earlier — stripped tools are removed from the MCP server entirely, so they cannot be invoked and their schemas never enter context. The PreToolUse hook block is only useful if you cannot edit the MCP server env (e.g., shared config).

The `graphify query` interception lives inside `smart-grep-hook.sh` and requires no extra config — it fires via the existing Bash PreToolUse hook.

#####  Making This Work for Any Project

The hooks in `settings.example.json` are designed to be portable — they silently no-op when the relevant tool or graph data isn't present. This means you can copy them to `settings.local.json` per-project, or into `~/.claude/settings.json` to activate across all projects.

**What the hooks do (each row is a no-op when the relevant tool/file is missing):**

| Hook | What fires | When | Resource-safe? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stop | CRG `update + embed` (background, PID-guarded — silent if not installed/initialized) | Once after AI finishes each turn (all edits batched) | PID file prevents overlap |
| PreToolUse | `smart-grep-hook.sh` (graph-first routing — adaptive: CRG only, graphify only, both, or silent fallback) | Before every grep/find/graphify query | Read-only, no resource concern |
| PreToolUse | Linter config guard | Before writing ESLint/Prettier/Biome | N/A |
| SessionStart | Graph cheatsheet (adaptive: shows CRG tools, graphify CLI, both, or nothing) | Session open, only if graph exists | Read-only |
| SessionStart | Setup nudge (only when CLI installed but graph not initialized) | Session open | Read-only |

**What the git hooks do (resource-guarded, all platforms):**

| Hook | What fires | When | Guards |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| post-commit | graphify rebuild + CRG update + embed (both background nohup) | Every commit | `_resources_ok` + `pgrep` + `timeout 300` |
| post-checkout | graphify rebuild + CRG update/build (smart: ≤5 files incremental, >5 full) | Branch switch only | `_resources_ok` + `pgrep` + `timeout 300` |
| pre-commit | Branch protection (blocks direct commits to master/development/release branches) | Every commit attempt | — |

>  **graphify is not in the Stop hook.** Running `graphify update` after every AI turn causes long-running background processes that accumulate, spike CPU, and exhaust swap. graphify update fires only via git hooks (`post-commit`, `post-checkout`) where it runs detached after the developer's action — invisible latency.
> 
>  

**Why no `get_architecture_overview_tool` block hook?** The recommended setup uses the `CRG_TOOLS` allow-list to strip that tool entirely (see "Strip Unused CRG Tools"). A stripped tool cannot be invoked, so the explicit block hook becomes redundant. If you cannot or do not want to strip, add the PreToolUse block as a fallback.

**Project `.claude/settings.json`** is only for project-specific *permissions* — which package-manager commands to allow, which config files to protect. Graph hooks go in `settings.example.json` (committed reference) and `settings.local.json` (live copy) — or your global `~/.claude/settings.json` if you want them everywhere.

**One-time setup per project — pick what you have installed:**

```
# CRG only (embedding-aware, MCP integration)
code-review-graph install
code-review-graph embed

# Graphify only (pure CLI, zero MCP overhead)
graphify init .
graphify update .

# Both — run all four; the smart-grep-hook routes CRG-first, graphify on miss

# Git hooks — graphify ONLY updates via git hooks (too slow for Claude hooks)
code-review-graph hook install   # post-commit: CRG update + embed (also runs in Stop hook)
graphify hook install            # post-commit + post-checkout: graphify update (background nohup)

```

After setup: every time the AI finishes a turn, the Stop hook fires once — **CRG only** updates in background (PID-guarded, ~0.425s, no pile-up). Every commit triggers both git hooks. graphify never runs from a Claude hook — only from git hooks. If only one tool is installed, only that one updates. If neither is installed, hooks are silent no-ops.

####  Step 4: Verify Your Setup

Run the checks for whichever tools you installed. Skip the rows for tools you did not install — there is no requirement to have both.

#####  Check CLI installation

```
# Either or both:
graphify --help | head -3            # graphify only
code-review-graph --version          # CRG only
# code-review-graph 2.3.2

```

#####  Check graph outputs exist

```
# Graphify (skip if not installed):
ls graphify-out/
# cache  graph.html  graph.json  GRAPH_REPORT.md  manifest.json

# CRG (skip if not installed):
code-review-graph status
# Nodes: 5780  Edges: 30611  Files: 1052
# Languages: bash, javascript, vue, typescript
# Last updated: 2026-05-05T18:29:51

```

#####  Check GRAPH\_REPORT.md freshness

```
head -15 graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md
# ## Corpus Check
# - 1020 files · ~1,587,186 words
# - Verdict: corpus is large enough that graph structure adds value.
#
# ## Summary
# - 3815 nodes · 4830 edges · 750 communities (533 shown, 217 thin omitted)
# - Extraction: 87% EXTRACTED · 13% INFERRED · 0% AMBIGUOUS
#
# ## Graph Freshness
# - Built from commit: `4968d67a`
# - Run `git rev-parse HEAD` and compare to check if the graph is stale.

```

#####  Check Stop hook is in settings.json (or settings.local.json)

```
python3 -m json.tool .claude/settings.json | grep -A5 '"Stop"'
# Should show the CRG PID-guard command
# PostToolUse should be empty ([]) — graph updates moved to Stop hook

# Verify PostToolUse is cleared (no graph update commands there):
python3 -m json.tool .claude/settings.local.json | grep -A3 '"PostToolUse"'
# Should show: "PostToolUse": []

```

#####  Check MCP server config

```
cat .mcp.example.json
# Should show: code-review-graph serve entry
# Copy to .mcp.json locally if it doesn't exist yet:
cp .mcp.example.json .mcp.json

```

#####  Check git hooks

```
# Husky projects (hooks live in .husky/, not .husky/_/)
grep -c "graphify" .husky/post-commit
# 1 (or more)

# Plain git projects
head -5 .git/hooks/pre-commit

```

#####  Test incremental update speed

```
time code-review-graph update --skip-flows
# real  0m0.425s  ← CRG incremental speed (runs in Stop hook after each AI turn)

time graphify update .
# SHA256 cache skips unchanged files — subsequent runs are near-instant
# Note: graphify is slower (~10s on large repos) — this is why it moved to Stop
# hook (once per turn) rather than PostToolUse (once per file edit)

```

#####  Test vault sync (if vault is configured)

```
cp graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md ai-vault/graphify/GRAPH_REPORT.md
ls ai-vault/graphify/
# GRAPH_REPORT.md

```

####  Step 5: Query the Graphs

#####  Graphify CLI

```
# BFS traversal — find connections between concepts
graphify query "what connects payment to enrollment" \
  --graph graphify-out/graph.json --budget 1500

# Depth-first traversal for flow tracing
graphify query "auth flow" --dfs --graph graphify-out/graph.json

# Shortest path between two nodes
graphify path "UserDashboard.vue" "PaymentService" \
  --graph graphify-out/graph.json

# Plain-language explanation of a node
graphify explain "UserDashboard.vue" --graph graphify-out/graph.json

```

Example output from `graphify explain`:

```
Node: UserDashboard.vue
  Source:    packages/client/src/views/Dashboard
  Community: 239
  Degree:    3

Connections (3):
  --> UserDashboard()  [imports_from] [EXTRACTED]
  --> handleApiError() [contains]     [EXTRACTED]
  --> AuthService      [calls]        [INFERRED]

```

#####  Inside Your AI Agent

After `graphify install` and `code-review-graph install`, your AI agent gets graph tools automatically. For Claude Code, a `SessionStart` hook shows the graph status on every session open. Cursor, Gemini CLI, and Windsurf pick up the MCP server from `.mcp.json` instead.

####  Step 6: Auto-Update Strategies

The graph is only valuable if it reflects current code. Here are the four strategies, from manual to fully automatic.

#####  Strategy A: Manual Update (Always Available)

```
# Incremental (only changed files — fast)
code-review-graph update        # 0.425s on ~1000-file project
graphify update .               # SHA256 cache, AST-only

# Full rebuild (when switching branches or major refactors)
code-review-graph build
graphify update . --force

```

#####  Strategy B: Auto-Update via Git Hooks (Recommended for graphify)

graphify update belongs in git hooks, not in Claude Code hooks. The incremental rebuild takes ~10s+ on a real monorepo — too slow for a per-turn trigger. Git hooks fire at the right moment: after a commit or branch switch, when the developer has already moved on.

```
graphify hook install   # installs post-commit + post-checkout

```

The post-commit hook runs the rebuild **in the background** (detached `nohup` process) so `git commit` returns immediately. Rebuild logs go to `~/.cache/graphify-rebuild.log`. The post-checkout hook fires on every `git checkout <branch>` and rebuilds for the new branch state.

This is the **only** recommended automatic trigger for `graphify update` — do not add it to `Stop`, `PostToolUse`, or `SessionStart` hooks.

The hooks installed by `graphify hook install` — both run as detached `nohup` so the git operation returns immediately. **Add the `_resources_ok` function** (shown in the post-commit hook above) to the top of each hook file to prevent resource exhaustion.

**`.git/hooks/post-commit`** — see the full resource-guarded version in the "Auto-Update on Commit" section above.

**`.git/hooks/post-checkout`** (or `.husky/post-checkout` for Husky projects):

```
#!/bin/sh
# Knowledge graph tools are optional — each section silently skips if tools are absent.

# _resources_ok function — copy from the post-commit hook above
# (CPU ≤ 50% of logical cores, memory ≥ 2 GB free — same implementation)

PREV_HEAD=$1
NEW_HEAD=$2
BRANCH_SWITCH=$3

# Only run on branch switches, not file checkouts

  _LOG="${HOME}/.cache/code-review-graph-update.log"
  mkdir -p "$(dirname "$_LOG")"
  if [ "$_FULL_REBUILD" = "true" ]; then
    echo "[code-review-graph] Branch switched (full rebuild: ${_CHANGED_COUNT:-?} files diff) - launching background build (log: $_LOG)"
    nohup sh -c 'code-review-graph build' > "$_LOG" 2>&1 < /dev/null &
  else
    echo "[code-review-graph] Branch switched (incremental: ${_CHANGED_COUNT:-?} files diff) - launching background update (log: $_LOG)"
    nohup sh -c 'code-review-graph update --skip-flows && code-review-graph embed' > "$_LOG" 2>&1 < /dev/null &
  fi
  disown 2>/dev/null || true
fi

```

Key differences from post-commit:

* Only runs on actual branch switches (`BRANCH_SWITCH=1` check)
* Smart rebuild: ≤5 files diff → incremental update; >5 files or new branch → full rebuild
* CRG uses `build` (full SQLite rebuild) for large diffs, `update --skip-flows` for small ones
* graphify sets `GRAPHIFY_FORCE=true` for large diffs to force full AST reparse

#####  Strategy C: Git Hooks (On Commit + Branch Switch)

Both tools install git hooks automatically:

```
# code-review-graph: pre-commit hook in .git/hooks/pre-commit
code-review-graph install

# graphify: installs hooks in .git/hooks/ — for Husky projects, copy the hook logic to .husky/post-commit
graphify hook install

```

The graphify post-commit hook runs the rebuild **in the background** (detached process) so `git commit` returns immediately. Rebuild logs go to `~/.cache/graphify-rebuild.log`.

#####  Strategy D: Claude Code Hooks (AI-Driven Updates)

**Only CRG belongs in Claude hooks. graphify does not.**

| Tool | Claude hook? | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **code-review-graph** | ✅ Stop hook | ~0.425s incremental — safe after every AI turn |
| **graphify** | ❌ No Claude hook | ~10s+ on large monorepos — causes hanging background processes, CPU spike, swap exhaustion |

When an AI agent edits files, the `Stop` hook triggers a CRG incremental update. `code-review-graph install` writes hooks into `.claude/settings.json` initially — move them out. The right home is `.claude/settings.example.json` (committed reference for teammates) and `.claude/settings.local.json` (your live runtime copy, gitignored).

Use the fallback-safe version that silently no-ops if the CLI isn't installed:

At **0.425s per update**, CRG runs after every AI turn without blocking the agent's workflow.

The **`settings.example.json` hooks** (copy to `settings.local.json` for this project, or to `~/.claude/settings.json` for all projects):

>  **Why Stop, not PostToolUse?** `PostToolUse` fires after *every* individual file edit — if Claude makes 10 edits in one response, it fires 10 times. The PID-file guard has a race window, so concurrent CRG Python processes pile up. `Stop` fires **once** when the AI finishes its entire turn — all edits batched, single update, PID-guarded. Zero pile-up by design.
> 
>  **Why `PostToolUse: []`?** Explicitly empty. Previous setups used PostToolUse for CRG updates. Clearing it prevents stale hook configs from double-triggering with the Stop hook.
> 
>  

####  Step 7: Generate Additional Outputs

>  **Resource exhaustion prevention** — all git hooks above include a `_resources_ok()` guard that checks CPU load (≤ 50% of logical cores) and available memory (≥ 2 GB) before spawning any background rebuild. If either threshold is exceeded, the rebuild silently skips and logs why. This prevents a real problem: rapid-fire commits (amend chains, interactive rebase) spawning multiple concurrent graphify/CRG processes — observed at 3 stuck processes at 65–73% CPU each, load average 12+, RAM saturated, machine unresponsive. The `pgrep` guard adds process-level deduplication (if a previous rebuild is still running, skip). The `timeout 300` ensures no background process lives longer than 5 minutes. Together these three guards ensure graph rebuilds are always non-blocking and device-safe.

#####  Wiki (Markdown pages per community)

```
code-review-graph wiki
# Wiki: 28 new pages → .code-review-graph/wiki/

graphify tree --graph graphify-out/graph.json
# D3 collapsible-tree HTML

```

#####  Interactive Visualization

```
code-review-graph visualize
# → .code-review-graph/graph.html

# graphify-out/graph.html is generated automatically during build

```

#####  Blast-Radius Analysis

```
# What does this commit affect?
code-review-graph detect-changes --base HEAD~1 --brief

# Risk-scored output:
# Analyzed 3 changed file(s)
# - 2 changed function(s)/class(es)
# - 1 affected flow(s)
# - Overall risk score: 0.42

```

####  Step 8: Obsidian Vault (Visual Graph + Persistent Memory)

The Obsidian layer adds a **human-readable, visual knowledge graph** on top of your codebase. You've probably seen screenshots shared in the Claude Code / graphify community — a force-directed graph of hundreds of connected nodes. That's Obsidian's Graph View rendering one `.md` file per symbol, linked by imports.

**Install Obsidian:**

```
# Ubuntu
snap install obsidian

# macOS
brew install --cask obsidian

```

#####  Three Vault Modes

| Mode | Where | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Browser only** | `graphify-out/graph.html` | One-off exploration, no Obsidian needed |
| **Project vault** | `<project>/ai-vault/` | Single project, clean wikilinks |
| **Global vault** | `~/obsidian-vault/` | Multiple projects + cross-repo merged view |

#####  Mode 1: Browser Only (Zero Setup)

The `graph.html` file graphify generates is a self-contained interactive D3 force graph — drag nodes, zoom, click to inspect. No Obsidian required.

```
xdg-open graphify-out/graph.html   # Linux
open graphify-out/graph.html        # macOS

```

#####  Mode 2: Project Vault

The project vault lives at `./ai-vault/` inside the project (gitignored). It has two layers:

**Layer 1 — Basic (GRAPH\_REPORT.md only):**

```
mkdir -p ai-vault/{graphify,permanent,logs,chats}
cp graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md ai-vault/graphify/

```

This gives you the community report with wikilinks — useful for navigating clusters.

**Layer 2 — Rich vault (one .md per symbol):**

The GRAPH\_REPORT.md uses wikilinks like `[[_COMMUNITY_Community 0]]`, but those target files don't exist yet. To make Obsidian's Graph View actually light up with a full network, generate individual note files for every node and community:

Save this script to `~/.graphify/gen-obsidian-vault.py`:

python3 ~/.graphify/gen-obsidian-vault.py --project-root .
# ✓ 3815 nodes · 4830 links · 749 communities → ./ai-vault

```

This generates `ai-vault/nodes/` (one `.md` per symbol) and `ai-vault/communities/` (one `.md` per cluster). Each file contains wikilinks to its neighbors — Obsidian's Graph View draws the edges automatically.

```
ai-vault/
├── .obsidian/               ← Obsidian config (auto-created)
├── nodes/                   ← one .md per function / class / file  ← NEW
├── communities/             ← one .md per module cluster           ← NEW
├── graphify/
│   └── GRAPH_REPORT.md      ← synced from graphify-out/
├── permanent/               ← Architecture decisions (human notes)
├── logs/                    ← Session records
└── CLAUDE.md                ← vault-level agent instructions

```

Open in Obsidian → press `Ctrl+G` → you get the full network.

#####  Mode 3: Global Vault (Multiple Projects)

One Obsidian window, all projects. Each project goes into its own subfolder with namespaced wikilinks — necessary because two projects often share node IDs (shared packages like `dto`, `types`, `utilities`).

```
# Add each project to the global vault
python3 ~/.graphify/gen-obsidian-vault.py \
  --project-root /path/to/project-a \
  --vault ~/obsidian-vault \
  --project-name project-a

python3 ~/.graphify/gen-obsidian-vault.py \
  --project-root /path/to/project-b \
  --vault ~/obsidian-vault \
  --project-name project-b

```

```
~/obsidian-vault/
├── 00-Welcome.md           ← optional index note
├── project-a/
│   ├── nodes/
│   ├── communities/
│   └── graphify/GRAPH_REPORT.md
├── project-b/
│   ├── nodes/
│   ├── communities/
│   └── graphify/GRAPH_REPORT.md
└── merged/                 ← optional cross-repo combined view

```

**Filter by project in Graph View:** Graph View sidebar → Filters → `path:project-a/nodes`

#####  Cross-Repo Merged View

When projects share types or utilities, merging their graphs reveals bridge nodes — code that affects both sides.

```
graphify merge-graphs \
  /path/to/project-a/graphify-out/graph.json \
  /path/to/project-b/graphify-out/graph.json \
  --out ~/obsidian-vault/merged-graph.json

python3 ~/.graphify/gen-obsidian-vault.py \
  --merged-graph ~/obsidian-vault/merged-graph.json \
  --vault ~/obsidian-vault \
  --project-name merged

```

Nodes in `merged/communities/` that link to both projects are your highest-impact change points — changing them ripples across repos.

#####  Switching Between Vaults

This is a common pain point: clicking `X` quits Obsidian entirely and the next launch reopens the same vault.

**Switch inside Obsidian (always works):**  

 Click the **vault icon** at the very bottom-left of the sidebar (looks like a small building/safe). A panel lists all known vaults — click to switch.

**Open two vaults simultaneously (Obsidian v1.x+):**  

 Open the vault switcher → hold `Ctrl` while clicking a vault → opens in a new window. Both are live at once.

**From the terminal — Linux snap install:**

The `obsidian://` URI scheme and `xdg-open` do not work with snap-installed Obsidian because snap doesn't register the protocol with the system. Use a small helper script instead.

Save `~/.graphify/obs.py`:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Open a specific Obsidian vault from the terminal (snap-compatible)."""

    OBSIDIAN_CONFIG.write_text(json.dumps(c, indent=2))

def open_vault(vault_path):
    path = str(Path(vault_path).expanduser().resolve())
    config = _load()
    vaults = config.setdefault("vaults", {})
    vid = next((k for k, v in vaults.items() if v.get("path") == path), None)
    if vid is None:
        vid = hashlib.md5(path.encode()).hexdigest()[:16]
        vaults[vid] = {"path": path, "ts": int(time.time() * 1000)}
        print(f"Registered: {path}")
    for k in vaults: vaults[k].pop("open", None)
    vaults[vid]["open"] = True
    _save(config)
    print(f"Opening: {path}")
    subprocess.Popen(["/snap/bin/obsidian"], start_new_session=True,
                     stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) < 2: print("Usage: obs.py <vault-path>"); sys.exit(1)
    open_vault(sys.argv[1])

```

This registers the vault in Obsidian's JSON config and launches Obsidian pointing to it.

**Shell aliases (add to `~/.zshrc` on macOS, `~/.bashrc` on Linux):**

```
alias obs='python3 ~/.graphify/obs.py ~/obsidian-vault'
alias obs-project='python3 ~/.graphify/obs.py /path/to/your-project/ai-vault'

```

Then: `source ~/.zshrc` (or `source ~/.bashrc` on Linux) and use `obs` / `obs-project` from any terminal.

**macOS (non-snap):**

```
open "obsidian://open?vault=obsidian-vault"
# or
alias obs='open "obsidian://open?vault=obsidian-vault"'

```

**Practical tip — avoid switching entirely:**  

 Keep the global vault as your default. Inside Graph View, use the path filter to scope to one project:

* Graph View sidebar → Filters → `path:my-project/nodes`

This shows only that project's symbols without switching vaults.

#####  Graph View Filters

| Filter | Shows |
| --- | --- |
| `path:nodes` | All code symbols |
| `path:my-project/nodes` | One project's symbols (global vault) |
| `path:communities` | Module clusters only |
| `path:permanent` | Architecture decisions (human notes) |
| `path:logs` | Session records |
| `-path:nodes` | Human notes only, no code graph |

#####  `ai-vault/CLAUDE.md` (vault-level agent instructions — Claude Code example; use `AGENTS.md` or `GEMINI.md` for other agents)

```
## Session Commands
- `/resume` — Read the latest log in `logs/` to restore context
- `/save` — Write a timestamped session summary to `logs/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`

## Navigation
- `graphify/GRAPH_REPORT.md` — Codebase graph report
- `permanent/` — Architecture decisions and atomic notes
- `logs/` — Session records

## Graph Usage
Before answering architecture questions, read `graphify/GRAPH_REPORT.md`.
Use `graphify query`, `graphify path`, and `graphify explain` from the project root.

```

#####  Keeping the Vault Fresh

Git hooks keep `graph.json` current automatically. Refresh the Obsidian notes after significant changes:

```
# Project vault
python3 ~/.graphify/gen-obsidian-vault.py --project-root .

# Global vault entry
python3 ~/.graphify/gen-obsidian-vault.py \
  --project-root /path/to/project \
  --vault ~/obsidian-vault \
  --project-name my-project

# Rebuild merged view
graphify merge-graphs \
  /path/to/a/graphify-out/graph.json \
  /path/to/b/graphify-out/graph.json \
  --out ~/obsidian-vault/merged-graph.json && \
python3 ~/.graphify/gen-obsidian-vault.py \
  --merged-graph ~/obsidian-vault/merged-graph.json \
  --vault ~/obsidian-vault \
  --project-name merged

```

#####  Add vault regen to git hooks

**Husky projects:** create `.husky/post-commit` (git-tracked; note `.husky/_/` is gitignored and dead code — the `h` wrapper always exits before any appended code there runs).

**Plain git projects:** use `.git/hooks/post-commit` instead.

The hook is structured in two independent sections so teammates without these tools see zero overhead — each section guards itself and silently no-ops if the tool isn't present:

```
#!/bin/sh
# Knowledge graph tools are optional — each section silently skips if tools are absent.

# _resources_ok function — copy from the post-commit hook above
# (CPU ≤ 50% of logical cores, memory ≥ 2 GB free, all platforms)

GIT_DIR=$(git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null)
[ -d "$GIT_DIR/rebase-merge" ] && exit 0
[ -d "$GIT_DIR/rebase-apply" ] && exit 0
[ -f "$GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD" ] && exit 0
[ -f "$GIT_DIR/CHERRY_PICK_HEAD" ] && exit 0

# ── graphify: rebuild graph after commit ─────────────────────────────────────
# Entire block skips if graphify is not installed.
if command -v graphify > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  CHANGED=$(git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD 2>/dev/null || git diff --name-only HEAD 2>/dev/null)
  if [ -n "$CHANGED" ]; then
    # (Python interpreter detection omitted for brevity — see full hook above)
    if [ -n "$GRAPHIFY_PYTHON" ] && ! pgrep -qf 'graphify' 2>/dev/null && _resources_ok; then
      export GRAPHIFY_CHANGED="$CHANGED"
      _LOG="${HOME}/.cache/graphify-rebuild.log"
      mkdir -p "$(dirname "$_LOG")"
      echo "[graphify hook] launching background rebuild (log: $_LOG)"
      nohup timeout 300 $GRAPHIFY_PYTHON -c "
import os, sys
from pathlib import Path
changed_raw = os.environ.get('GRAPHIFY_CHANGED', '')
changed = [Path(f.strip()) for f in changed_raw.strip().splitlines() if f.strip()]
if not changed:
    sys.exit(0)
from graphify.watch import _rebuild_code
_rebuild_code(Path('.'))
" > "$_LOG" 2>&1 < /dev/null &
      disown 2>/dev/null || true
    fi
  fi
fi

# ── code-review-graph: incrementally update MCP graph index after commit ────
if command -v code-review-graph > /dev/null 2>&1 && [ -d .code-review-graph ] && ! pgrep -qf 'code-review-graph update' 2>/dev/null && _resources_ok; then
  _LOG="${HOME}/.cache/code-review-graph-update.log"
  mkdir -p "$(dirname "$_LOG")"
  echo "[code-review-graph] Commit detected - launching background update (log: $_LOG)"
  nohup sh -c 'code-review-graph update --skip-flows && code-review-graph embed' > "$_LOG" 2>&1 < /dev/null &
  disown 2>/dev/null || true
fi

```

>  **Why `timeout 300`?** graphify `_rebuild_code` has no internal deadline. On large repos it can hang indefinitely if it hits a file lock, encoding error, or memory pressure. `timeout 300` auto-kills the background process after 5 minutes — the git commit returns immediately either way, and the next commit retriggers a fresh attempt.
> 
>  **Why `_resources_ok`?** Without it, rapid-fire commits (amend chains, rebase, interactive rebase) spawn multiple concurrent graphify processes. Observed: 3 stuck processes at 65–73% CPU each, load average 12+, RAM exhausted. The resource check ensures a rebuild only starts when the machine can handle it.
> 
>  

Create the same file at `.husky/post-checkout` with one change: wrap the graphify block with `if command -v graphify > /dev/null 2>&1 && [ -d "graphify-out" ]` (force-rebuild only when the graph has been built before). Mark both executable: `chmod +x .husky/post-commit .husky/post-checkout`.

**What "safe to commit" means here:** a developer with none of these tools runs exactly the 4 rebase guards and exits 0 — no Python spawned, no directories created, no errors.

####  Complete Auto-Update Flow

After full setup, the pipeline looks like this:

```
AI agent session opens (Claude Code shown — other agents use equivalent plugin hooks)
    → SessionStart: code-review-graph status
    → SessionStart: setup nudge (only if CLI installed but no graph built yet)
    → SessionStart: graph cheatsheet injected (query→tool map, ~150 tokens, once per session)

AI agent searches the codebase (grep / rg / find)
    → PreToolUse: smart-grep-hook.sh intercepts
        ├── no graph / non-code target / --graph-tried flag → pass silently
        ├── first grep this session
        │     ├── graph has answer → show answer in context, allow grep (one-shot lesson)
        │     └── graph has no answer → allow grep, suggest MCP tool
        └── subsequent grep
              ├── graph has answer → deny with answer inline (zero retry, saves 2000+ tokens)
              └── graph has no answer → pass silently

AI agent edits a file
    → Stop hook (once per full AI turn): code-review-graph update --skip-flows (0.425s)
    [graphify does NOT update here — too slow for per-turn trigger]

Code committed
    → post-commit: _resources_ok() check
        ├── CPU > 50% or memory < 2 GB → skip rebuild, log why
        ├── pgrep: graphify already running → skip
        └── resources OK → graphify update . (background nohup, timeout 300)
    → post-commit: _resources_ok() check
        ├── pgrep: CRG already running → skip
        └── resources OK → code-review-graph update + embed (background nohup)

Branch switched
    → post-checkout: diff count = git diff --name-only PREV NEW | wc -l
        ├── ≤5 files OR same-base branch switch
        │     ├── graphify: incremental update (SHA256 cached, fast) [resource-guarded]
        │     └── CRG: update --skip-flows + embed [resource-guarded]
        └── >5 files OR brand-new branch
              ├── graphify: force full rebuild (GRAPHIFY_FORCE=true) [resource-guarded]
              └── CRG: build (full SQLite rebuild) [resource-guarded]

Result: developer commits or switches branches → both graphs update in background (if device has resources).
        Agent edits files → CRG updates after each AI turn.
        Agent searches → graph answers before grep fires.
        Device overloaded → rebuilds silently skip, next commit retries.

```

####  Quick Reference

>  Each block below is independent — install only the tools you want. Pure CLI setup → graphify only. Embedding + MCP setup → CRG only. Full stack → both.
> 
>  

#####  Installation

```
# Either, both, or pick one:
pip install graphify              # graphify (CLI only)
pip install code-review-graph     # CRG (CLI + MCP server)
# Or via uvx / pipx — see the Installation section earlier in this guide

```

#####  Project Setup (run once per project, for each tool you installed)

```
# Create ignore files (only the ones you need)
touch .graphifyignore                 # graphify only
touch .code-review-graphignore        # CRG only

# Build graphs manually
graphify update .           # graphify: JSON graph, AST-only (no tokens)
code-review-graph build     # CRG: SQLite graph (fast, no tokens)

# Register with your AI agent (run only the lines for installed tools)
graphify claude install     # graphify hooks + CLAUDE.md trigger
graphify hook install       # graphify post-commit hook
code-review-graph install   # CRG MCP server + skills + hooks

```

#####  Verify (run only the rows for tools you installed)

```
code-review-graph status            # CRG: node/edge counts
head -15 graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md  # graphify: corpus + freshness
time code-review-graph update --skip-flows   # CRG: should be <1s
python3 -m json.tool .claude/settings.local.json | grep -A3 PostToolUse

```

#####  Daily Commands (each line targets one tool — use what is relevant)

```
# Manual incremental update
graphify update .           # graphify: SHA256 incremental
code-review-graph update    # CRG: 0.4s

# Query (graphify CLI)
graphify query "auth flow" --graph graphify-out/graph.json
graphify path "ComponentA" "ServiceB" --graph graphify-out/graph.json
graphify explain "MyService" --graph graphify-out/graph.json

# Blast-radius review (CRG)
code-review-graph detect-changes --base HEAD~1 --brief

# Status (CRG)
code-review-graph status

# Wiki / visualization (CRG)
code-review-graph wiki
code-review-graph visualize

```

#####  Watch Mode

```
graphify watch .                  # continuous auto-rebuild (graphify)
code-review-graph watch           # continuous auto-rebuild (crg)

```

####  Why Not a Vector Database?

Code navigation is fundamentally relational — `UserController` calls `AuthService` which imports `TokenRepository`. This is a directed graph, not a bag of vectors.

|  | Knowledge Graph | Vector DB |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code structure | Topology-exact | Approximate |
| Setup | No embedding pipeline | Embedding + chunking + sync |
| Hallucination | None (AST is deterministic) | Can return similar-but-wrong |
| Cost (indexing) | 0 tokens (AST mode) | Embedding cost per file |
| Incremental update | 0.4s (SQLite diff) | Re-embed changed chunks |
| Exact symbol lookup | Use grep/LSP (still best) | Often worse |

Knowledge graphs excel at **"how does X relate to Y"** questions. For exact symbol lookup, grep and LSP still win — and both tools' `PreToolUse` hooks (or equivalent agent config) redirect the agent toward the graph for structural questions while leaving grep for exact matches.
